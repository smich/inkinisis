# Pages

This dir includes scss files pertaining to specific pages. For instance, itâ€™s not uncommon to have very specific styles 
for the home page hence the need for a `_home.scss` file in `pages/`.

However, since we have adopted a micro-app project structure, the application specific files can be found in the app
dir, under the following path:
`<app-name>/assets/sass`
